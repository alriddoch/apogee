2001-09-18  Al Riddoch  <ajr@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

	* app/perigee.cpp: Renamed perspective version of the client perigee,
	  and create new build target for it.

	  to using the new IsoClient application class.

	* visual/DemeterScene.cpp: Window title should be perigee for
	  perspective renderer.

	* visual/Isometric.cpp: Disabled smooth shading for performance while
	  developing. Added drawGui() method for isometric renderer, similar
	  to that for perspective.

	* visual/Sprite.cpp: Fixed sprite loading code, and adapted it so
	  it can be used for gui sprites as well as in game ones.

	* visual/Renderer.h, visual/Isometric.h, visual/DemeterScene.h:
	  Added drawGui() pure virtual function.

	* visual/Model.cpp: Removed code which fiddles with the depth test,
	  as this is now controlled by the renderer class.

	* visual/DemeterScene.cpp: Added code to draw experimental gui
	  graphics. Added lighting setup code. Modified projection code
	  so the window can be resized. scale is tied to the windows
	  height.

	* app/Editor.cpp, visual/DemeterScene.cpp: Worked out how to scale
	  cally character rendering.

	* visual/DemeterScene.cpp, visual/DemeterScene.h: Added z_offset, and
	  sorted out correctly positioning character and map using the same
	  camera offsets.
