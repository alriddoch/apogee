I took the work I did in Feb. on an OpenGL experimental client, added in
some network and world code, displayed the world entities as wire-frame
boxes, and there it is:- apogee.

The code is in forge/client/apogee, and is checked in and working.
It requires coal and Atlas-C++ 0.4.3. It displays the world
using OpenGL with on orthographic projection, which means it
can do isometric, plan view, side elevation, or any view in between.

Here are some screen shots:

Isometric:

zoomed out of the same view:

plan view:

side elevation:

These screenshots were taken with the map renderer and sprite demo
enabled, which are disabled by default. All you can do currently is
login, and monitor what is going on in the server. To move the view use
the mouse with the middle and right buttons. To reset to isometric,
press 0. Use the cursor keys to center the view.

It relies on server entities having bounding boxes in the emerging
standard Atlas way.
