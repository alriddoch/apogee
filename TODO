For expo, change textures to nearest, and Lod to much lower.

Implement new Eris Entity class which carries pointer to associated terrain.
Use same technique for a whole load of other rubbish to do with rendering.
Perhaps a virtual method would help.

Draw roads on the terrain using a similar technique to the hull one. Drawing
vertically extended cuboids along the length of the roadwhich intersect with
the terrain to create the stencil data, and then draw the whole terrain using
this stencil to get the roads.

Terrain is now working better. Need to tie new tilemap code to heightmap code,
using triangle strips instead of those naughty quads.

Make terrain work.

Make light and sound work.

Implement a worldforge client.

Thoroughly test eris ingame code.

Thoroughly test eris outofgame code.

Once Eris is up and running, add code to handle other characters.

Add code to application which calcs character coord relative to root,
and sets renderer offset accordingly
