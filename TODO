ALPHA blending onto area written by GL currently doesn't work, as it seems
to assume that the background is what was there before GL started. Is this
a bug, or can I do something about it?

Setting a video mode as OPENGLBLIT leaks a surface. Can this be fixed? It
is an internal to SDL problem, and it is marked as TODO in the source.
