This is apogee, an experimental codebase to trying and testing 3D client
ideas for worldforge. It currently consists of a single codebase which
builds two executables, apogee and perigee. apogee renders its view in
the isometric projection, and perigee render in the perspective projection.

In order to build apogee and perigee you will need cal3d 0.6 installed
with headers on the include path in a directory called cal3d, and libraries
on the link path. You will also need the demeter terrain engine from
http://www.terrainengine.com/ installed, with the headers on the include
path, and the non OSG version of the library on the link path.

In order to run apogee and perigee, you will need some test media in place.
The working directory must contain the following:

media - a link to the worldforge media repository. apogee expects this
	directory to contain a link to the worldforge media-2d repository,
	as used in Acorn.

media-3d - a link to the worldforge media-3d repository

maps -	a link to the maps directory provided with demeter terrain engine
	version 3 or later

data -	a link to the data directory in the cal3d cally demo package
	The files in this data directory expect the cal3d data package
	to be in ../cal3d_data
